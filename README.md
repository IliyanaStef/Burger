# Burger

Description:
This application is a burger logger built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. The application uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

How It Works:
Burger is an app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page--waiting to be consumed.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a button to eat it. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
Burgers on the right side of the page have a delete button to remove it from view.
